The most basic repo for a Chrome extension w/ React. The UI supported is a popup (i.e when a user clicks the Chrome Extension icon on the top bar, a self-contained UI pop ups). For Chrome Extension UIs that are injected into the webpage the user is on, clone [TODO] instead.

Pedagogically built to learn Webpack.

To understand the build process, read webpack.config.js

To run, `npm run build` generates the `dist/` folder, which you should upload to Chrome
